These are tests for operational transformation when branches have multiple ops
before they are brought back together. Therefore they also effectively do some
testing for how Hazards are collected and applied during ot (even though they
are not explicitly mentioned in many of these tests).

Tips for Writing OT Tests
===

To fully test sequences of ops, they should be added to changesets, which are
then added to a document. The document then handles ot. Documents can be
created with an initial snapshot, then the root changeset is a 'set' op with
that python object.
:: 
   doc = Document(snapshot='123abcde789') 
   root = doc.get_root_changeset()

By default, when a doc is created, changesets it receives are added to a
queue, and are not immediately applied. To automatically pull from the queue,
mark that the document has no event loop:
::
   doc.HAS_EVENT_LOOP = False

Notes for Reading OT Tests
===

OT tests are written systematically where possible (meaning 'hardly
ever'). There are too many combinations for combining ops, so tests are more
anecdotal than comprehensive. Also, some tests are based on glitches found when
actually working collaboratively, so they can but unnecessarily lengthy or
convoluted.
