MajorMajor
==========

MajorMajor is a library for handling peer-to-peer, real-time,
collaborative document editing. It is meant to be used as a plugin for
existing desktop applications, giving them the ability to be used
collaboratively over a network. MajorMajor requires no central
server. Users just send messages to each other over whatever protocol
they choose, and MajorMajor is responsible for keeping the group in
sync.

Quick Start
-----------

Checkout the code over ssh:
`git clone git@majormajor.org:repos/majormajor.git`

or over http:
`git clone http://git.majormajor.org:/majormajor.git`


Sample Text Editor
------------------

Try the sample text editor in the scripts directory:
```
$ python texteditor.py
```

Then in a separate terminal, or separate computer on the same network,
open another instance of the text editor bound to a different port:
```
$ python texteditor.py 8080
```

You now have two text editors open and keeping each other in sync as
you type. To really watch it fly, click the big red button in each
text editor, and they will randomly insert and delete text.

The save buttons dump the text buffers to files, so they can latter be
compared (hopefully anti-climactically).
```
$ diff buffer-*.txt
$
```

Tests
-----

The tests are done with pytest. From the project root, run `py.test`.

Goals vs. Status
----------------

MajorMajor minimally works, but is not nearly complete.

 - **Full JSON Support** -- MajorMajor currently only handles plain
     text, but is designed to eventually handle any json document.
 - **Easy Integration** -- With some glue, MajorMajor should be easily
     plugged into existing desktop programs. Currently it is hard
     coded to work with some GObject based examples.
 - **Arbitrary Network Protocols** -- Messages between users are
     currently UDP packets broadcast over a local network. However the
     Connection module is extensible, and should handle anything
     (http, IRC, XMPP, TorChat)
